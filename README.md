Note that **since it's impossible to access private IG users data(because you don't really follow that user), you can only follow public IG users in this bot.**

# HOW TO RUN PROJECT #
This project is build in following environment:  
> **Java version: Java 8**  
> **Framwork: Spring Boot 1.5.8 + line-bot-api 1.10**  
> **Server platform: [Heroku cloud application platform](https://www.heroku.com/)**  
> **Database: PostgreSQL 9.4.1212**  

If you want to run this project, follow these steps:  

### 1. Import database
There are 2 tables which record user and IG users' latest media. Import them to your own database. [table script](./src/main/webapp/dbScript)  
  
### 2. Create a channel for your bot:  
Follow this [tutorials](https://developers.line.me/en/docs/messaging-api/building-bot) to create bot.  
You'll see bot's **access token** and **channel secrete** at setting page, these will be used at following steps.

To receive request from the Line platform, the webhook must be enabled.  
Enabled webhook and set webhook url at setting page. Â

### 3. Create an instagram account & receive access token
Create an instagram account, and follow this [tutorial](https://www.instagram.com/developer/authentication/) step by setp to get **access token**.  
Be sure that token has the *public_content* permission.
  
### 4. Modify application.yml
> * Paste linebot's **access token** and **channel secret** at [application.yml](./src/main/resources/application.yml).  
> * Set **handler.path** depend on your server url
  
### 5. Modify application.properties
> * Paste database setting at [application.properties](./src/main/resources/application.properties), including *driver*, *url*, *username*, and *password*
> * Paste **instagram access token** as well
  
### 6. Deploy project to server  
Since the webhook URL must use HTTPS, I deploy it on Heroku.  
If you want to deploy server on other place, be sure to use HTTPS.
